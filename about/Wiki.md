# Wiki

## State

This wiki originated as a [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/a/puredarwin.org/puredarwin/), then was migrated to a GitHub Wiki, and then ported to this website.

In the migration to GitHub, and therefore conversion to Markdown from HTML, a lot of formatting and many images were lost. The efforts of ninjadev64 have restored almost all of the images, fixed grammatical and formatting issues in the About and News categories, and removed most of the junk HTML tags lying around in pages. Additionally, many pages are more than a decade old, so many links are broken - please try to relocate them instead before removing them!

## Style guide

This is the style guide you should follow when editing or creating wiki pages, or cleaning up broken ones.

### Headers

Headers should only be created using proper # syntax. No ====== or ------ should be used at all, and any existing occurences should be removed. All headers should be both preceded and followed by a newline.

H1s (single #) should be used only at the very start of a page. These should not be preceded by a newline.

### Links to other pages

Never include the `.md` suffix. For pages in the same category, provide only the page name in the link. For pages in other categories, provide the full path from the root (e.g. `/developers/Bochs`).

### Lists

For lists with no particular order, use `-` as the item prefix. Otherwise, use an ordered list, with `123.` as the item prefix.

### HTML

HTML should be avoided at all costs. Any Google Sites HTML remnants should be replaced with proper Markdown syntax.

### Trailing newline

All files should end with a single trailing newline.
