# Wiki style guide

This page details the style guide you should follow when editing or creating wiki pages, or cleaning up broken ones.

### Headers

Headers should only be created using proper # syntax. No ====== or ------ should be used at all, and any existing occurences should be removed. All headers should be both preceded and followed by a newline.

H1s (single #) should be used only at the very start of a page. These should not be preceded by a newline.

### Links to other pages

Never include the `.md` suffix. For pages in the same category, provide only the page name in the link. For pages in other categories, provide the full path from the root (e.g. `/developers/Bochs`).

### Lists

For lists with no particular order, use `-` as the item prefix. Otherwise, use an ordered list, with `123.` as the item prefix.

### HTML

HTML should be avoided at all costs. Any Google Sites HTML remnants should be replaced with proper Markdown syntax.

### Trailing newline

All files should end with a single trailing newline.
