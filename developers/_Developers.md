For developers
==============

### Prerequisites ###
In order to do any serious PureDarwin development, please familiarize yourself with the [DarwinBuild](developers/darwinbuild.html) project and the [MacPorts](developers/macports.1.html) project, as these are the key components of building software for Darwin.
### PureDarwin releases ###
See [PureDarwin Xmas](downloads/xmas.html).
If you want to have a look at a minimalistic bootable Darwin 9 system, check out [PureDarwin nano](downloads/puredarwin-nano.html).
### Testers wanted ###
To qualify as a tester for the current PureDarwin installer, you'll need

-   An Intel Mac with Leopard (to run the installer and to test whether the PureDarwin USB drive can be booted)
-   A USB drive, 1GB or larger (will be completely erased)
-   Latest VMware or [VirtualBox](developers/virtualbox.html) release
-   Fast Internet connection (to download Darwin 9 packages)
-   A good backup since there are absolutely no guarantees

Please contact us in [irc #puredarwin](irc.freenode.net) if you want to be a tester.

### Useful tools ###
A utility for browsing through the contents of [binary roots](http://xref.puredarwin.org/) is available. It currently covers Darwin build 9F33, and provides links to relevant source code, and binaries.

### Darwin mailing lists ###
Have a look at the Darwin [mailing lists](developers/planet.html).

### Documentation
This wiki is a place for users and developers alike to document and discuss Darwin.
See below for some pages we have already started.
