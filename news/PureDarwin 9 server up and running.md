# PureDarwin 9 server up and running

A PureDarwin 9 server is up and running (in private, for now - see below). 

We have created a custom PureDarwin 9 ISO with the scripts and tools from our repository as described [here](/developers/PureDarwin%20repository), installed [networking](/developers/Network), [OpenSSH](/users/OpenSSH), [Apache](/users/Apache), [MacPorts](/developers/Using%20MacPorts/Using-MacPorts), [Netatalk](/users/Netatalk), configured [Bonjour](/users/Bonjour), even installed [TightVNC](/users/TightVNC) for graphical applications... set up [SpeedStep](/users/SpeedStep) to save some power... all running nicely. 

Thanks for everyone who has contributed toward making PureDarwin this viable.

At the moment we are looking for a co-location and hardware sponsor so that we can run a PureDarwin 9 server system 24/7 and make available its services publicly.
