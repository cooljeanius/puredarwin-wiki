XBS

### What is XBS?
In case you come across the term "**XBS**": Apparently, this is what Apple's **Build and Integration team** uses to compile projects for Mac OS X. It is a proprietary build system and is not available outside Apple. 

For the outside world, there is [[DarwinBuild]] instead. 
It is not known how much the two build systems have in common.
