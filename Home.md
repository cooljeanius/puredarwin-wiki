[Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29) is the open source operating system from Apple that forms the base for macOS, iOS, tvOS, etc.

PureDarwin is a community project to make Darwin more usable on its own (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin).

One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO of Darwin.
Another goal of this project is to provide additional documentation. [More](/about/_About)...

Regarding broken, outdated, or incomplete wiki content, as well as contributing to the wiki, please see the [Wiki page](/about/Wiki).

## Getting the code

Please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin).

## Status

MacPorts is running on PureDarwin 9, potentially giving us thousands of open source software titles.

The screenshot above shows a PureDarwin 9 system created from the scripts in our repository, running on real hardware, using TightVNC and [XFCE](/users/Xfce) from MacPorts.

The [Current Blockers](/developers/Current%20blockers) page shows where we currently are.

As of now, you can either build a PureDarwin system yourself based on the information on this site and our and Apple's open source and DarwinBuild source code repositories, or download "[PureDarwin Xmas](/users/Xmas)", a developer preview of the operating system based on Apple's Darwin 9 sources and other Open Source projects.

At the same time, the PureDarwin project would like to invite the community to discuss, participate and contribute.

The developer preview is available for download as a pre-configured virtual machine for [VMware](/developers/VMware) Fusion 2.0 on Macintosh, and the code used to generate it is available in a Subversion/Mercurial repository form.

A minimal PureDarwin system known as "[PureDarwin Nano](/users/PureDarwin-Nano)" is also available, where only one process is running (a shell).

The Wiki pages were recently moved from [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/a/puredarwin.org/puredarwin/) to GitHub, and then to this website, and in the conversion process some formatting was lost. Please help fixing the Markdown of the pages by editing it. But please delete nothing, especially not (broken) images; fix them instead (see the main page of the Wiki for an example).
